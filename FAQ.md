## How do I use a different account for a repository in SourceTree?
1. First add this account using `Tools > Options > Authentication > Add`.
2. Then, when cloning the repository, modify the URL to this format: `https://[USERNAME]@[ORIGINAL-REPO-URL]`.\
   Eg. when using the account `XDoubleU` for cloning this repo I would use: `https://xdoubleu@github.com/xdoubleu/git-hub-workshop`.
3. Finally, edit the user information for that repository by using, when on the tab of this repository, `Settings > Advanced > uncheck 'Use global user settings' > Update Email address > OK`.
4. Afterwards you will probably have to restart SourceTree.
